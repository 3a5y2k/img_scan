# img_scan
This program identifies duplicate files, including images and videos, by analyzing their pixel hashes. These hashes are generated based on the actual pixel data of the files, ensuring accurate detection of duplicates, even if the file names or metadata differ.

Once duplicates are identified, the program allows you to:

View the list of duplicate files.
Delete selected duplicate files to free up storage space.
Reorganize entire folder structures by moving or grouping files based on their hash values, ensuring a clean and structured media library.
This makes it a powerful and efficient tool for managing large collections of images and videos, ideal for use in photo and video libraries, digital asset management systems, or media repositories.
